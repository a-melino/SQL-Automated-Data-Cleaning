### Background and Data Information

This is a sample project intended to showcase advanced SQL data cleaning skills featuring automation. This dataset used real data and is provided by [AnalystBuilder.com](https://www.analystbuilder.com/) via the US Government. 

The SQL queries are contained within the main directory of this repo under the name 'queries.sql'. Automation is acheived using a stored procedure and an event.
